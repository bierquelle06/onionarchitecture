# Onion Architecture In ASP.NET Core With CQRS

Onion Architecture, the game changer is that the Domain Layer (Entities and Validation Rules that are common to the business case ) is at the Core of the Entire Application. This means higher flexbility and lesser coupling. In this approach, we can see that all the Layers are dependent only on the Core Layers. A software architectural pattern that promotes a modular and maintainable structure by organizing code into concentric layers. The layers represent different concerns, with the core functionality at the center and external dependencies in the outer layers.

## Overview

This project is an Onion Architecture In ASP.NET Core. Also with WebApi that follows a variant of Onion Architecture so that we get to see why it is important to implement such an architecture in your upcoming projects.

## Full Fledged Clean Architecture Solution for ASP.NET Core WebApi
I am building a more complex variant of this implementation that will be production ready.
